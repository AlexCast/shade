 cone  (str_cone)

 The structure below implements a positive (in)finite cone. The cone is 
 described by the position of its vertex, the orientation of its axis, the 
 positive heights, relative to vertex, along the axis and by the cosine of it
 half angle (i.e., the angle between the axis and the surface).

 For example, an infinite positive cone has height[0] = 0 and 
 height[1] = INFINITY. A truncated infinite cone has height[0] > 0 and a 
 truncated finite cone has height[0] > 0 and height[1] < INFINITY.

 Two additional descriptions are necessary to caracterize (and describe) if 
 the cone is open, semi-closed (one end) or closed (both ends).

 With the convention used for intersections in this code, the cone parameters 
 are retained in its own reference frame and the ray is centered and rotated if
 necessary. Therefore, all the relevant information becomes the vertex, its half
 angle, the heights, rotation flag and the rotation matrix. Additionally, the 
 properties of the caps are stored as ellipses and transformations are relative
 to the cone axis. Those are all calculated with a setup function.

 The cone is setup by the str_cone_setup function with values that can be read
 from the standard input file with the function str_cone_read.

   S_top[t] S_top[p] Closed[Base] Closed[Top]

 The function str_cone_setup describes the parameters that must be passed to 
 create a cone structure.
