 cylinder (str_cyln)

 This structure implements a general positive (in)finite cylinder (right 
 circular or oblique) with arbitrary orientation axis of the cylinder's normal 
 and rotation around the normal. The cylinder is defined by its origin, radius, 
 height along its axis, azimuth rotation in its own reference frame (alpha), and
 orientation of the Z-axis (normal) in the system's reference frame.

 Additionally, the cylinder may be open or closed in the top and bottom sides. 
 Those "caps" are represented by ellipses. The inclination with regard to the
 cuboid axis can be any value between 0 and 60ยบ. Therefore it is possible to 
 have an oblique-circular cylinder. The other limit of the caps is that they 
 must have the same alpha as the cylinder.

 With the convention used for intersections in this code, the cylinder 
 information is retained in its own reference frame and the ray is centered and
 rotated if necessary. Therefore, all the relevant information becomes the
 origin, the radius, the height, rotation flag and the rotation matrix. 
 Additionally, the properties of the caps are stored as ellipses and 
 transformations are relative to the cylinder axis. Those are all calculated
 with a setup function.

 The cylinder is setup by the str_cyln_setup function with values that can be
 read from the standard input file with the function str_cyln_read.

 STANDARD INPUT FILE SPECIFICATION:
 O[X] O[Y] O[Z] S[t] S[p] Alpha Radius Height S_base[t] S_base[p] S_top[t] 
   S_top[p] Closed[Base] Closed[Top]

 The function str_cyln_setup describes the parameters that must be passed to 
 create a cylinder structure.
