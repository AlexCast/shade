 findInterv

 Function to find the interval index where a value lies. It is open at the left
 and closed in the right. Breaks extremes can be be -INFINITE and INFINITE.

 However, is not very efficient... if the break points form regular intervals, 
 the function finBin (aux.h header file) is many times faster.
 
 INPUT: 
 val  - Scalar value
        Range: (-Inf,Inf), undefined units
        Constant double;
 brks - Vector of breaks
        Range: [-Inf,Inf], undefined units
        Pointer to constant double;
 n    - Number of break points
        Integer range: (0,Inf), unitless
        Constant int.

 OUTPUT:
 The index of the interval in which the value lies.
