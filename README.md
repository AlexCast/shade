# shade: Radiative transfer simulation for shadowing related error in hydrology optics

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

A radiative transfer solver using the Monte Carlo method to estimate error related to instrument and platform shading in hydrology optics measurements.

The code is well documented and a wiki will be available soon.
